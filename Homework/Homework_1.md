The literary character "Robin Hood" is well known in western culture.  In the lore, he is a hero who, along with his gang of merry men, famously "robs from the rich and gives to the poor."  Today, the character stands as a symbol for anyone that fights against large and established institutions with the intent of liberalizing, democratizing, or otherwise making the innaccessible accessible to the general public.

Enter the modern day "Robinhood": a completely online broker that (amongst other newer features) was the first to offer commission free trading.  Founded in 2013 by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt in Menlo Park, California, the company has grown over the past 5 years and as of December 4th 2019 has over 10 million users by targeting "a new generation of investors", namely, Millenials.

## Overview and Origin

Prior to founding Robinhood, Vladimir Tenev (Vlad) and Baiju Bhatt (Baiju) were students at Stanford University. Upon graduation they moved to New York to build high-frequency trading platforms where they came to the realization that large brokerage firms were making money by charging exhorbitant brokerage fees. Vlad and Baiju decided to create their own online brokerage firm that offered commission free trading.  In 2015 they became publicly accessible and since their inception have operated under the mission to:

>"democratize our financial system. We believe that everyone should have access to the financial markets, so we’ve built Robinhood from the ground up to make investing friendly, approachable, and understandable for newcomers and experts alike."
-Robinhood Mission statement

As of 2019 the business is credited as being valued at 7.6 Billion dollars.

## Business Activities

Robinhood is in the highly competetive Financial services industry and is most noteably competing in online equities brokering. The brokerage industry is as old as the markets themselves.  Fidelity, one of the largerst online retail brokers, was founded in 1946 and thanks to its ability to keep pace with technologies and trends in the industry is still the broker of choice for over tens of millions of users worldwide.  

Robinhood set out to solve the problem of making financial markets accessible to everyone.  When the company went public in 2015, the application offered $0 commission trades and no minimum account requirements.  This strategy has successfully led to attracting millenials to use the Robinhood platform.  In 2019 the company is credited with having over 10 million users with over 50% of users using Robinhood as their first trading platform.

Millenials and the following generation labeled "Gen Z" are growing in size.  Per a recent bloomberg article it is expected that in 2019 Gen Z and Millenials will account for over 60% of the global population (32% and 31.5% ).  Likewise, Robinhood's users have grown as well.  Over 2019 the number of users has grown from 6 million to over 10 million and has surpassed the number of users on it's competitor E-Trade.  

Robinhood continues to offer innovations to it's platform.  Robinhood recently announced 2 new features: 1. Fractional shared trading which allows users to purchase fractions of shared of stocks and 2. Cash Management which functions similarly to a bank account that can accrue interest or be used to make purchases.  Additionally, Robinhood has a paid platform that offers subscribers access to financial data and analyses through it "gold" package for the cost of $5 per month. These features not only allow Robinhood to attract new entrants to the financial markets, but also expand the needs of their existing customers.

## Results

Robinhood has succeeded in its mission so far.  The company has not only grown in value and number of users, but more importantly has made a fundamental change in the way online bokerage firms operate.  In October of 2019, Major online brokers including Charles Schwab, E-trade and Fidelity have followed suit and are now offering commission free trades.  

>“We’re proud of the fact that we’ve enabled so many younger investors and first-time investors to have access to the markets because we believe that the more people that have access to the markets and can start investing earlier the better off our economy will be.”
-Vladimir Tenev 2019 Mad Money Interview

As mentioned above, the number of users for Robinhood is growing; however, since Robinhood is a privately owned company their revenue and other financial information is not available.  We can compare Robinhood to it's competitors through recent valuations:

*   Robinhood: $7.6 B
*   E-Trade: $9.7 B
*   TD Ameritrade: $19.5 B
*   Charles Schwab: $50.4 B
>US News and World Report April 2019

Comparing companies using user numbers, you can see that Robinhood is succeeding in their mission of bringing more users to equity trading accounting for over 25% of the current number of users among the 4 companies listed.

*   Robinhood: 10M +
*   E-Trade: 7.1M (WSJ 2019)
*   TD Ameritrade: 11M (TD Ameritrade website)
*   Chales Schwab: 10.755M (wikipedia)

There are currently rumors that Robinhood will go public with the possibility of an IPO offering in 2020.

## Recommendations

By offering a bare-bones platform, commision-free trades, and no minimum account requirements, Robinhood not only granted access to equities trading to more users, but has also helped itself grow to compete with the larger broker institutions. The company continues to add more services to accomodate its existing users as well as allow their platform to compete with the more traditional online brokers.  With these adaptations, however, the line between small startup and large bank are becoming more blurry.  This company that once touted itself as being a no-frills broker to the masses is now in the process of becoming a large financial institution which begs the question, "What now?"

Technologically, it is difficult to differentiate Robinhood's platform from other brokers and users seeking a more robust platform may find themselves gravitating to the more established institutions.  This is why I would recommend Robinhood seeking partnership with a larger institution.  Robinhood would offer its current offerings with the exception of the Gold subscription and Cash Management functions and would be for users under a minimum account value. After users accounts have grown over a certain amount, the user would have the option of having thier account upgraded to an account that has access to the partner's resources that would include features such as access to a bank account, charting applications, exotic instruments, and brick and mortar locations which Robinhood currently doesn't have.  

By partnering with a larger firm Robinhood can continue to operate as a separate company and offer its users more services that they will eventually desire.  This will help Robinhood continue their mission of offering entry to the marketplace to all while also allowing users to seek services from larger institutions.
